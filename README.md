Instances used in "Caselli, G., Delorme, M., & Iori, M. (2022). Integer Linear Programming for the Tutor Allocation Problem: A Practical Case in a British University. Expert Systems with Applications, 187, 115967."
Instances for the Tutor Allocation problem are included in the folder "Instances", which is organized in subfolders as follows.
Each subfolder is called "experiment_settingsX_N_M" where X is a serial number, N is the number of tutors, and M is the number of courses.
Serial number X indicates following sets of instances as presented in the paper.
Each subfolder includes a set of instances. Each instance i is characterized by 8 files, each one related to different elements of the problem:
- "TAP_BASIC_i" includes metadata of the instance;
- "TAP_CONF_i" includes data on the configurations;
- "TAP_COURSE_i" includes data on the courses;
- "TAP_FORBIDDEN_i" includes forbidden configurations for courses;
- "TAP_FORCED_i" includes forced configurations for courses;
- "TAP_SECTION_i" includes data on the sections;
- "TAP_ST_i" includes data on the supertutors;
- "TAP_TUTOR_i" includes data on the tutors.
